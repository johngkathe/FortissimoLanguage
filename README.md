# FortissimoLanguage
## What is Fortissimo (.ff)?
Fortissimo is a gradually typed (well, I'm working towards that part), C-based language currently under construction.  My goal is to create a language suitable for Web 3.0 development with a bytecode VM that "compiles" to WASM in the browser (figuring out what to do with it natively) and friendly to JavaScript developers yet robust.  The goal with syntax is to be concise and minimalistic when it is sensible to do so.
